<h1 align="center">Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Saiket Ramteke</h1>
<h3 align="center">A passionate frontend developer from India</h3>

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on **E-commerce project**

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning **Full Stack Web Development,DSA**

- ðŸ‘¯ About this project **This portfolio project holds special significance for me. It all started when a close friend of mine, a talented photographer, asked me to help him create a website to showcase his stunning photography. As someone passionate about design and development, I eagerly took on the task, excited to combine my skills with his creativity. Coincidentally, on the very same day, I received a task from my internshipâ€”a requirement to build a personal portfolio to present my own work. The timing was perfect! I saw this as an opportunity to not only help my friend but also develop a framework I could adapt for my own professional growth. I decided to combine these projects into a single initiative, using the skills I gained through my internship to build a clean, functional, and visually engaging portfolio that serves both purposes. This project reflects not only the technical skills Iâ€™ve honed but also my love for collaboration, creativity, and problem-solving.**
